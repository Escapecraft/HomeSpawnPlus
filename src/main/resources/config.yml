# The events below allow use of the strategies described here. Web
# doc reference:
# http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/homespawnplus/pages/strategy-doc/
#
# The strategies are processed in the order listed, so if you list a
# strategy first that is guaranteed to always return a location, such
# as SPAWN_DEFAULT_WORLD, then none of the other strategies will ever
# fire.
#
# Not all strategies make sense for all events, for example
# "homeDefaultWorld" doesn't make a lot of sense for "onSpawnCommand";
# you can use it if you want, but it'll probably just confuse your
# players.
#
# In the event that no strategies return a location, DEFAULT is assumed
# as the last strategy in the chain (you can explicitly add it if you
# like).
#
# homeLocalWorld: find their primary home on whatever world they are on
# homeDefaultWorld: find their primary home on the default world
# homeMultiWorld: convenience strategy combining the above two,
#   searches local world first then default world
# homeNearest: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (will search for nearest home on
#   local world)
#
# spawnNewPlayer: this strategy only has an effect on the very first
#   join of a new player, it will send them to the spawn set by
#   "/setfirstspawn"
# spawnLocalWorld: send the player to the spawn point defined for the
#   local world (this does nothing if /setspawn has never been used in
#   that world)
# spawnDefaultWorld: send the player to default spawn in the default
#   world. This strategy ALWAYS works, so if you use this, make sure it
#   is at the end of your strategy list.
# spawnGroup: send the player to the spawn defined by their Perm2-group,
#   as defined by "/setgroupspawn" command
# spawnNearest: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (will search for nearest spawn in
#   local world)
#
# default: this is the logical assumed end of every strategy chain, this
#   will basically not do ANYTHING and let Bukkit do whatever is the
#   default for the given action. bThis aborts any further strategy
#   processing when it fires.

  # at all, no point in having even the small overhead associated with
  # processing these events)
