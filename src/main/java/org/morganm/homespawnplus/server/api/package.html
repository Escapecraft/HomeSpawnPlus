This package contains the API that HSP uses to interface with the server that it is running on. This
implementation is then implemented by specific wrappers to servers that HSP is compatible with.

HSP was originally written for Bukkit only, so this API generally represents the features needed
by HSP of the Bukkit API (which is a subset of full Bukkit functionality). Keeping this interface
to the bare minimum of what HSP needs simplifies testing and simplifies future compatibility
efforts with other APIs.
