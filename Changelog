v0.9.1 - ???
* added per-world event control capabilities, so that you can define an event
strategy chain that takes place only on a specific world
* fixed a bug that prevented groupspawn from working properly
* added new "onGroupSpawn" event type so that admins can define custom
strategy chains even for GroupSpawns (for example, you might want it to obey
spawnWGregion, or perhaps not do any groupspawning on certain worlds, etc)
* added 'spawnGroupSpecificWorld' strategy, since otherwise groupSpawn is
always relative to the world the player is in (in part, b/c Perm systems
allow perm/groups to be local to each world). This gives the admin the
ability to allow /groupspawn to always point to "world", for example, or
even just on certain worlds, it could point to another world.
* added new strategies: homeAnyWorld, homeSpecificWorld and
spawnGroupSpecificWorld. Read wiki strategy doc for more info on these.
* added strategy "modes", which is a way to alter the way existing
strategies work in order to get even more specific behaviors.
* changed base command permission to no longer need ".use" suffix. For
example it's just "hsp.command.home" now. I have maintained the check
for ".use" to make upgrading easier, but the old ".use" permission syntax
will be dropped in a future version.

* new command: /setdefaultspawn to allow for defining the default spawn
out of multiple named spawns that might exist in a world

plugin to takeover if other plugins are using it (ie. usurp "/home" from
CommandBook, which loads first alphabetically)
* new feature: implemented "spawnNearest" spawn strategy

v0.8 - September 27, 2011
* changed base permission prefix from 'HomeSpawnPlus' to 'hsp'
* added flexible spawn/home strategies, see default 'config.yml' or documentation
* added warmup capability
* added firstLogin capability for newbie spawning
* conceptual notion of "nearest" spawn/home introduced, strategy not fully
implemented yet
* config options have changed, automatically move old one out of the way and
copy the new default into place
* implemented data backup and restore (use /hsp backup, /hsp restore)
* added Superperms permission nodes
* BUGFIX: fixed problem that prevented sleeping in beds at night
* BUGFIX: fixed a bug that prevented group spawning from working properly

v0.7 - July 17, 2011
* made it so "defaultWorld" is also the default spawn world for new players
* added "core.defaultPermissions" so admins can enable defaultPermissions if
they aren't using a Permission-compatible plugin
* added an option for telling HomeSpawnPlus to track player last logout location
and send them there on next login (if onJoin="default"), instead of letting
default Bukkit track location, which seems to get it wrong sometimes (sends
people to surface or down into lava, etc)
