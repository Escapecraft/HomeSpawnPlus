v1.3.1 - January 14, 2012
* finished off localization of strings, HSP strings are now fully localized. Now it just needs translations other than just English!
* fixed a bug with limit cascading (unreported)
* Ticket #47: permission system "op" taking precedence over "superperms"
* Ticket #50: WEPIF not being used when using WorldEdit release 5.0
* Ticket #54: NPE related to HSP localization in /home command
* Ticket #48: Support for /groupspawn group arguments (permission: hsp.command.groupspawn.named)

v1.3 - January 1, 2012
* enhancement, Ticket #22: /homedelete to accept w:world argument
* enhancement, Ticket #29: stuck in chunk hole when teleporting
* enhancement, Ticket #23: i18n (internationalization) support (config option: core.lang)
* added "core.defaultMessageColor" option for changing default message color
* message localization is NOT complete! There are a LOT more strings to be added, I've just gotten the work started (maybe ~25% done).
* will need volunteers for additional langauges. English ("en") is the only one provided at this time.
* BIG BIG thanks to Hidendra (LWC) for letting me adapt his localizaton code for HSP's use

v1.2.2 - December 29, 2011
* Ticket #37/#38/#40: first spawn not working properly
* Ticket #36: SQL CONSTRAINT error due to new player check not working
* Ticket #43: "basic" config being copied into config_defaults.yml
* Ticket #39: NoClassDefError for WEPIF: now prints warning if using old
version of WorldEdit instead
* Ticket #32: implement "group.XYZ" groups for Superperms (code borrowed
from WEPIF)

v1.2.1 - December 25, 2011
* Ticket #33: fixed a bug in some situations with new player checks on
PLAYER_JOIN

v1.2 - December 25, 2011
* Ticket #24/#25/#30: cooldowns per-permission, per-world and per-home
* Ticket #24: warmups per-permission and per-world
* Ticket #24: cost per-permisson and per-world
* Ticket #25: add cooldown for /sethome
* Ticket #25: separate timer for "home-named" and "sethome-named"
* added a "basic" config.yml that is copied in place if none exists. This is a
bit simpler for new users to understand - the "config-defaults.yml" always
contains the full listing of options available.
* added /spawnlist and /spawndelete commands
* added "spawnLocalRandom" strategy for spawning at a random spawn point on
the local world

v1.1.3 - December 19, 2011
* Ticket #31: bugfix for /sethome taking money when player is at home limit

v1.1.2 - December 17, 2011
* Ticket #27: fix permissions for perm systems not supporting superperms
* some code cleanup/refactoring
* The above changes come with a new config option "permissions" which allow
you to select which permission system you want to use. By default it will go
through the list and use the first available, but now you can change it if you
want (for example, maybe you prefer to use WEPIF instead of Vault).

v1.1.1 - December 8, 2011
* fix for HSP throwing NPE when a world has been deleted
* fix for "/homelist <world>" not working properly
* added "onNamedHomeCommand" event type, called when player types "/home
name". New strategy "homeNamedHome" was added to match. This doesn't change
default functionality any, but it allows admins to influence the outcome of a
player typing "/home name" using home modes - for example you could use
"modeHomeNoBed" to disallow players using their bed homes on "/home name".
* added ability for HSP to respond to console commands to "/hsp" (so you can
"/hsp rc" to reload the config from the console, for example)

v1.1 - December 4, 2011
* Ticket #15: fixed a bug with modeHomeNoBed strategy
* Ticket #16: better firstLogin detection, check world/players/player.dat
* Ticket #17: fixed an NPE bug with /groupspawn command if no groupspawn is defined
* Ticket #19: fixed issue with warmups being canceled due to movement detection being too sensitive
* Ticket #13: new feature, config param "homeLimits.singleGlobalHome" to enforce a single global home that always changes when using /sethome (or a bed)
* new permission "hsp.singleGlobalHomeExempt" to be exempt from "singleGlobalHome" restriction
* added WorldEdit WEPIF support, which supports more permission systems for those who have WorldEdit (only used if Vault is not present)
* Fixed permission->world->global spawn strategies so they fall through. Before, if a
perm.onHomeCommand strategy was defined, but not perm.onDeath and a player
died who matched the perm, they would not get the world-specific or global
onDeath like you would expect. This is fixed.

v1.0.2 - November 29, 2011
* fixed permission "hsp.command.sethome.named" to be correct
* added modeHomeBedOnly mode strategy

v1.0.1 - November 27, 2011
* fixed a new SQL-related bug related to setting bed homes

v1.0 - November 27, 2011
* added ability for HSP to have multiple named homes per world (if you give your players access to /sethome)
* added config options to limit the number of homes globally, per-world or per-permission group (defaults to 1 per world, which maintains the same behavior before this feature was added)
* added per-world event control capabilities, so that you can define an event strategy chain that takes place only on a specific world
* added per-permission event control capabilities
* added new "onGroupSpawn" event type so that admins can define custom strategy chains even for /groupspawn
* many new strategies added, see web strategy doc for full details
* strategy "modes" added, which modify how existing strategies work to provide additional flexbility and control
* changed base command permission to no longer need ".use" suffix. ".use" suffix is deprecated but still works for now.
* new strategies required some small DB schema changes, added additional code to make DB upgrade seamless even for SQLite users
* updated configuration to use Bukkit's new preferred YamlConfiguration classes (hopefully no bugs)
* fixed a bug that prevented groupspawn from working properly
* added a "config_defaults.yml" file which will always contain the most current plugin defaults (for admin's reference)
* new user commands added: /homelist, /deletehome, /setdefaulthome, /homeother
* new op commands added: /sethomeother, /homedeleteother

Because of the Bukkit YamlConfiguration upgrade, HSP 1.0 now requires the Bukkit 1.0 dev builds (I've tested on #1493+). Do NOT try to run this on 1.8 #1337, it will not load.

v0.9.1 - November 26, 2011
* fixed bug ticket #10: /groupspawn not working
* fixed bug ticket #11: /spawn NPE (Vault-related)

* new feature: WorldGuard region-spawn support via "spawnWGregion" strategy

* new feature: spawnSpecificWorld strategy
* new feature: spawnNamedSpawn strategy
* new command: /setdefaultspawn to allow for defining the default spawn
out of multiple named spawns that might exist in a world
* new feature: usurpCommands - admin can specify commands s/he wants this
plugin to takeover if other plugins are using it (ie. usurp "/home" from
CommandBook, which loads first alphabetically)
* new feature: implemented "spawnNearest" spawn strategy

v0.8 - September 27, 2011
* changed base permission prefix from 'HomeSpawnPlus' to 'hsp'
* added flexible spawn/home strategies, see default 'config.yml' or documentation

* conceptual notion of "nearest" spawn/home introduced, strategy not fully
implemented yet

copy the new default into place
* implemented data backup and restore (use /hsp backup, /hsp restore)
* added Superperms permission nodes
* BUGFIX: fixed problem that prevented sleeping in beds at night
* BUGFIX: fixed a bug that prevented group spawning from working properly

v0.7 - July 17, 2011
* made it so "defaultWorld" is also the default spawn world for new players
* added "core.defaultPermissions" so admins can enable defaultPermissions if
they aren't using a Permission-compatible plugin
* added an option for telling HomeSpawnPlus to track player last logout location
and send them there on next login (if onJoin="default"), instead of letting
default Bukkit track location, which seems to get it wrong sometimes (sends
people to surface or down into lava, etc)

v0.6.2 - July 9, 2011
* Added ability for players to delete their homes (/home delete)
* Fixed multihome spawning

v0.6.1 - July 3, 2011

* Added YML config files
* Permission 3.0 support

v0.1
* Initial version
