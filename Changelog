v0.7 - July 17, 2011
made it so "defaultWorld" is also the default spawn world for new players
added "core.defaultPermissions" so admins can enable defaultPermissions if
they aren't using a Permission-compatible plugin
added an option for telling HomeSpawnPlus to track player last logout location
and send them there on next login (if onJoin="default"), instead of letting
default Bukkit track location, which seems to get it wrong sometimes (sends
people to surface or down into lava, etc)
