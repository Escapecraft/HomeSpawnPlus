To Build:
  The easiest way to build this project is to use Apache ant, all you have to do is type "ant" in the project directory and you'll get a working JAR in the "dist/" directory.

  But first, you need to download the 3 dependencies and put them into the "lib/" directory:
    * craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar    (tested with #935)
    * Permission.jar                    (tested with version 3.x) 
    * sqllite.jar                       - this is only required for the SpawnControl Converter. If you won't use this, feel free to delete the class and then you don't need this JAR. Most people have a copy of this laying around in their minecraft server lib directory already.
